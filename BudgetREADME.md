## Project Overview

The notebook explores how **budget correlates with critical and commercial outcomes** for movies, revealing patterns about investment size, movie quality (IMDB scores), and box office earnings. It addresses key questions:

- Is a larger budget linked to better scores or higher revenues?
- What is the typical budget dispersion in cinema?
- Are there low-budget sleeper hits or big-budget failures?

***

## Data Description

- **Base Dataset:** `moviescleaned.csv`
- **Typical Columns:**
    - `budget`, `gross`, `score`, `genre`, `year`, `runtime`, `name`, `released`
- **Scope:** Decades of industry data, multiple genres, countries, productions.

***

## Preprocessing & Cleaning

- **Loading & conversion:** Numerical columns (budget, gross, score) are cast to numeric, handling errors gracefully.
- **Missing values:** Addressed or excluded to ensure clean statistical analysis.
- **Transformation:** Log scale applied to financials for better visualization and comparison due to wide range of values.

***

## Analytical Methods

- **Distribution Analysis:**  
  - Histogram for **budget ranges**, highlighting the prevalence of low, moderate, and high-budget films.
- **Relationship Exploration:**  
  - **Budget vs. IMDB Score:** Are expensive movies usually better rated?
  - **Budget vs. Gross Revenue:** Does higher spending ensure higher return?
- **Scatter Plots & Trends:**  
  - Log scales to make patterns and outliers visible.

***

## Visualization Suite

- **Budget Histogram:**  
  - Log-transformed, showing where most films cluster.
- **Score-Budget Scatter:**  
  - Reveals relationships (or lack thereof) between rating and spending.
- **Gross-Budget Scatter:**  
  - Visualizes profitability extremes, ROI, and budget anomalies.

***

## Key Findings & Insights

- The industry is dominated by **modest-budget movies**; blockbusters are rare.
- Both well-rated and poorly rated movies span all budget categories—**money alone doesn’t guarantee acclaim**.
- There are **outliers:** cost-effective movies with impressive returns and big spenders with disappointing performance.
- **High budget often helps get higher revenues**, but ROI can be unpredictable.

***

## Getting Started

1. Place `moviescleaned.csv` in the notebook folder.
2. Open `Budget-1.ipynb` and execute every cell sequentially.
3. Inspect the in-notebook plots and read insights beneath each graph.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Libraries:**  
    - `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
